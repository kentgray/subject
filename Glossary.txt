	• K Drive: The primary network drive used by Kimley Horn for storing client project data.
	• Mapped Network Drives: Virtual drives that appear as local drives but actually connect to network storage locations.
	• Nasuni: A cloud-based file storage and synchronization system used by Kimley Horn for data management.
	• Nasuni Filer: Local caching device in each office that interfaces with the Nasuni cloud storage.
	• Nasuni-IQ: A data insights and analytics tool provided by Nasuni for better visibility into data usage and growth patterns.
	• Petabyte: A unit of data storage equal to 1,000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.
	• Prevail: A tool chosen by Kimley Horn for handling CUI, utilizing AWS GovCloud.
	• Production Data: The main working data for projects, stored primarily on the K drive.
	• Reference Data: Lower-risk data such as drone footage and aerials, stored on the W drive.
	• Relative Paths: File paths that are relative to the current working directory, used by AutoCAD.
	• Retention Policy: Kimley Horn's policy of keeping data snapshots for 12 years and a day.
	• ServiceNow: An IT service management platform used by Kimley Horn for automation, ticketing, and various IT operations and workflows.
	• SharePoint: A Microsoft platform used by Kimley Horn for file sharing and collaboration, particularly with external parties.
	• Snapshot: A point-in-time copy of data, used by Nasuni for version control and retention.
	• Universal Paths: File paths that work across different systems, as opposed to relative paths used by AutoCAD.
	• Volume: In the context of Nasuni, a large container for storing data, similar to a very large virtual hard drive.
	• Worm Storage: Write Once, Read Many storage, a data storage technology used by Nasuni.
	• Xref (External Reference): A feature in AutoCAD that allows linking external drawing files into the current drawing, often used for collaboration and managing complex projects.


Current infrastructure: 
​Storage
	• Primary storage: Nasuni
	• Backend storage: AWS S3 buckets
	- Regions: US East 1 and US East 2
	• Production volumes: Prod 1, Prod 2, Prod 3
	• Total capacity: 1.82 petabytes
	• Growth rate: ~7% per quarter, ~30% per year
​Nasuni Architecture
	• Nasuni filers (caching appliances) in each office
	• Local caching for improved performance
	• User access via mapped network drives (e.g., K drive)
	• DFS namespace for dynamic path management and failover
​Hardware
	• Nasuni filers: HP DL380 Gen 10 Plus servers
	• Owned and managed by Kimley Horn
	• Virtualization: Vmware

Data Lifecycle and retention:
Current Policies
	• Retention period: 12 years
	• Daily snapshots for version history
	• No automated archiving process
Data Types
	• Project files (CAD drawings, PDFs, etc.)
	• Emails related to projects
	• Various document types
