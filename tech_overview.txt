Challenges and Limitations
	1. Rapid data growth and increasing storage costs
	2. Lack of automated tools for data management and archiving
	3. Limited visibility into data usage patterns and growth
	4. Accidental folder moves by users
	5. No automated alerts for rapid data growth or potential issues
	6. Permissions management challenges
	7. Limited search capabilities within Nasuni
	
Proposed Solution Requirements
1. Vendor Agnostic
	• Proposed technology: AWS File Gateway
	• Benefits:
	- Integrates with existing AWS infrastructure
	- Provides file interface to S3 storage
	- Allows for future flexibility in storage providers
2. Search and Find Specific Files
	• Implement a robust search solution that can:
	- Index file metadata and content
	- Provide fast and accurate search results
	- Support complex queries and filters
3. Consolidated Archive for K Drive and Other Data Sources
	• Develop a centralized archive solution that:
	- Accommodates Nasuni K drive data
	- Integrates with other data sources (e.g., SharePoint, email archives)
	- Maintains consistent metadata and access policies across sources
	
Proposed Archival Process
	1. Project Initiation
	- Create project folder in Nasuni via ServiceNow automation
	- Apply standardized folder structure and naming conventions
	2. Active Project Phase
	- Monitor data growth and usage patterns
	- Implement tiered storage based on access frequency
	3. Project Closeout
	- Trigger archival process based on project status in Cost Point
	- Move data to read-only state in Nasuni
	4. Archival
	- Transfer data to AWS S3 using File Gateway
	- Apply appropriate storage class (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Glacier)
	- Index metadata and content for search capabilities
	5. Long-term Retention
	- Implement lifecycle policies in S3 for cost-effective storage
	- Ensure compliance with 12-year retention requirement
	6. Data Retrieval
	- Provide self-service portal for users to request archived data
	- Implement approval workflow for sensitive or large data requests
	
Technology Stack for Proposed Solution
	1. AWS Services
	- S3: Primary storage for archived data
	- File Gateway: Interface between on-premises and S3
	- Lambda: Serverless computing for automation tasks
	- CloudWatch: Monitoring and alerting
	2. Search and Indexing
	- AWS OpenSearch Service (formerly Elasticsearch)
	- AWS Kendra for AI-powered search capabilities
	3. Data Management and Workflow
	- Extend ServiceNow capabilities for archive management
	- Develop custom integrations with Cost Point and Nasuni
	4. Security and Access Control
	- AWS IAM for access management
	- AWS KMS for encryption key management
	5. Monitoring and Analytics
	- AWS CloudWatch for operational monitoring
	- AWS QuickSight for data analytics and visualization
	
Implementation Considerations
	1. Data Migration Strategy
	- Develop a phased approach for migrating existing data
	- Prioritize based on project status and data access patterns
	2. Performance Optimization
	- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed archived data
	- Optimize search index for large-scale data sets
	3. Cost Management
	- Utilize S3 storage classes to balance performance and cost
	- Implement data lifecycle policies for automatic transitions
	4. Compliance and Governance
	- Ensure WORM (Write Once Read Many) capabilities for regulatory compliance
	- Implement audit logging for all data access and changes
	5. User Training and Adoption
	- Develop comprehensive training materials for new archival processes
	- Provide ongoing support and documentation for end-users
	6. Scalability and Future-proofing
	- Design the solution to accommodate continued data growth
	- Allow for integration of new data sources and technologies
	By addressing these technical aspects and considerations, the proposed solution aims to meet Kimley Horn's requirements for a vendor-agnostic, searchable, and consolidated archive system while improving overall data management efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
