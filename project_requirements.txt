Project: Future State Data Management System

Project Overview:
"Develop an Engagement Solution Plan for a comprehensive Data Lifecycle Management system, focusing on data categorization, retention, and archival processes across the enterprise."
Key Objectives:
a) Establish data categorization guidelines
b) Define data retention guidelines
c) Outline project lifecycle states
d) Design an efficient archival process
e) Provide a roadmap for implementing the data lifecycle solution company-wide
Deliverables:
a) Data Categorization Guidelines:

Develop a framework for classifying data across all enterprise systems
Consider factors such as data sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and business value
Ensure guidelines are adaptable to various data types and sources

b) Data Retention Guidelines:

Create policies for how long different categories of data should be retained
Align retention periods with legal, regulatory, and business requirements
Include provisions for data that must be retained indefinitely

c) Project Lifecycle States Definition:

Define clear stages from project initiation to completion
Include guidelines for data management at each stage
Ensure alignment with existing project management methodologies

d) Archival Process Design:

Develop procedures for moving data to long-term storage
Include criteria for when data should be archived
Design processes for retrieval of archived data when needed

e) Enterprise System Inventory (if time permits):

Catalog systems that interact and share data within the enterprise
Identify data flows between systems
Highlight interdependencies that affect data categorization and retention

f) Implementation Roadmap:

Provide a phased approach for rolling out the data lifecycle solution
Include timelines, milestones, and resource requirements
Address potential challenges and mitigation strategies


Technical Considerations:

Integration with existing AWS infrastructure
Scalability to handle current data volumes (approx. 1.8 petabytes) with projected growth
Support for both active and archival data management
Robust search and discovery capabilities across all data states
Security and compliance measures, including access control and encryption
Cost-effective storage solutions, considering both hot and cold storage options


Engagement Approach:

Collaborate with stakeholders from various departments to ensure comprehensive guidelines
Consider industry best practices and regulatory requirements in all recommendations
Ensure the solution is flexible enough to accommodate future changes in data management needs
Provide clear, actionable recommendations that can be implemented across the organization


Deliverable Format:

Comprehensive written report detailing all aspects of the Engagement Solution Plan
Visual aids such as flowcharts for data categorization and project lifecycle states
Detailed implementation roadmap with Gantt chart or similar project management tool
Executive summary highlighting key recommendations and expected outcomes



Task for AI Agents:
"Research and develop components of the Engagement Solution Plan for the Future State Data Management System based on these updated requirements. Each agent should focus on their area of expertise (e.g., data categorization, retention policies, archival processes, system integration) and collaborate to create a cohesive proposal that addresses all aspects of the project. Ensure all recommendations are practical, scalable, and aligned with industry best practices and regulatory requirements."
